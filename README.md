# TripPlanner2.0
This is a newer version of the Trip Planner API project that I did last semester. However, this project will be done in Python and will also be done with my coding friend Kareem. This project will test the abilities of my data structure skills with ideas such as dictionaries, linked list, and weighted graphs with vectors.
